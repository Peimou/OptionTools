# OptionTools
It is my personal option tools in Python. Most of the codes are part of my homework at Columbia 
Engineering. I really appreciate professors' effort which greatly help me sharpen my skills. I picked 
some of the most frequently used codes and summarized them into this repo. 

## 1. BStools.py
This file includes most frequently used function in BS world, including calculations of
Greeks and implied Vol. 

## 2. LVM.py
This file includes some local volatility models. 
Currently, I only uploaded the code of Local Vol binomial tree and its visualization. 
I will keep updating my work which will include Mckean SDE and particle method.
