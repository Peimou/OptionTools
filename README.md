# OptionTools
It is my personal option tools in Python. Most of the codes comes from my homework at Columbia 
Engineering, and I picked up the most frequently used codes and summarized them into this repo. 

## Cores
This file contains basis classes which frequently used in Application parts.
### $MC.py
This py file contains the base classes of the binomial tree, Monte Carlo simulation, discrete and 
continuous markov chains.
### $Radnom.py
In model calibration, we will frequently use MLE. Therefore, I write an abstract distribution class which
produce the derivatives and score function of common probability distribution.

## Numeric
Currently, this file contains all numeric methods used in this tools.

### $NewtonRaphson.py
The implementation of famous Newton algo.


## Applications
### $BStools.py
This file includes most frequently used function in BS world, including calculations of
Greeks and implied Vol. 

### $LVtools.py
This file includes some local volatility models. 
Currently, I only uploaded the code of Local Vol binomial tree and its visualization. 
I will keep updating my work which includes Mckean SDE and particle method.
